# ICT-Bank-Perf-Dev-Africa-Analysis
Lead author on a paper focused on ICT adoption, bank performance and development in sub-Saharan Africa. In addressing this research question. In the analysis:

(i) we use different indicators for ICT and bank performance to allow for some form of robustness check to provide more reliable evidence regarding the relationship between ICT and bank performance. Such indicators include the following bank performance indices - returns on assets (ROA), returns on earnings (ROE), and net interest margin (NIM). Similarly, we use different indicators for ICT adoption and usage such as automated teller machines (ATMs) per 100,000 adults, ATMs per 1,000km2, and mobile money transactions; 

(ii) we employ the dynamic panel model to account for unobserved heterogeneity as well as the effects of lagged values of the endogenous variables in the model.
